          The 10th edition of MG Vadodara International Marathon was held on

          The 10th edition theme was Heritage Run, dedicated to fitness as a
          lifestyle choice and conservation of heritage. This edition of the
          marathon was a testament to self-reliance and ‘Atmanirbharta’ towards
          achieving fitness for oneself and for the nation, as part of the Fit
          India movement. This milestone edition saw a new route being charted
          through the old parts of the city, traversing many iconic landmarks,
          buildings and gates that are part of Vadodara’s heritage, making this
          a very special “Heritage Run”, with the start and finish point at
          Navlakhi ground with the majestic Lukshmi Vilas palace as backdrop.
