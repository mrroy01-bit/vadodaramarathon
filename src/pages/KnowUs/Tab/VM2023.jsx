        <p className="mt-5 mb-4 text-lg font-light text-left text-gray-700">
          The 2023 Vadodara Marathon is the landmark 10th edition and celebrates
          the Spirit of Fitness in Atmanirbhar India. The pandemic years taught
          all of us many lessons, yet the prime one is the need to fit and
          healthy. Fitness is an individual endeavor and nothing epitomizes
          self- reliance as running and Vadodara Marathon is the ultimate test
          of it. This edition of the marathon is a testimony of Self Reliance /
          Atmanirbharta towards achieving fitness for oneself and for the
          nation.

        <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-left text-gray-700">

          fitness helps keep immunity levels high, thus ensuring good health.

          under-privileged communities who couldn’t take care of themselves, and
