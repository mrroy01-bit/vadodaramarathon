          Vadodara Marathon (VM) was incepted in 2009, as a not-for-profit
          organization under Section 25 of the Companies Act. VM enthuses and
          encourages citizens to adopt a fitness oriented and healthy lifestyle.
          Each edition of the Marathon attracts elite professional runners from
          all over the world and India, along with citizens from Gujarat.

          Over the years, VM has developed a unique character of “Sports, Seva,
          Swachhta”, supporting social and civic causes with each edition of the
          Marathon. VM offers a platform to local NGOs to increase their
          visibility, raise awareness and funds for their causes, and increase
          their reach through networking.

        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-left text-gray-700">
          With each edition, Vadodara Marathon has grown from strength to
          strength. It is the largest international sporting event in Gujarat,
          and among the top 10 Marathons in India. Vadodara Marathon is

          Races (AIMS), Athletics Federation of India (AFI), and BDAAA (Baroda
